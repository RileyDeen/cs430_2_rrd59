Project 2: Raycast - CS430 - rrd59

Introduction

This project reads in a JSON file, renders an image, and outputs said image to a P6 file.

Installation

This command will allow you to compile the nessacary files for execution. "make"

Usage

This is a command line program. To execute my program use this pattern (ex.) "ppmrw 3 input.ppm output.ppm"

Known Issues

Currently the program can only read in an input JSON file and then save contents within a struct. There is several working mathematical equations. However, i had no idea what math or other thoughts i should have been having when rendering an image and saving said image. All in all it reads the input properly and outputs some information to the output file using project1 methods.

Used another repo for a couple days on accident.
